This is the companion repository to my presentation at `whitCon 2023`. Learn more about whitson and whitCon at <a href="https://whitson.com">their website</a>.

Learn more about `inflow performance relationships (IPR)`, the theory on which 
this inference method is based, <a href="https://manual.whitson.com/modules/well-performance/nodal-analysis/">here</a>. To further understand IPRs in unconventional reservoirs, try this <a href="https://onepetro.org/SPEURCC/proceedings/15URC/1-15URC/D011S001R001/183655">paper</a>.
